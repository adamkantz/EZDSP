    Abstract base class for a "performer" which can compile and execute a soul::Program.

    A typical performer is likely to be a JIT compiler or an interpreter.

    Note that performer implementations are not expected to be thread-safe!
    Performers will typically not create any internal threads, and all its methods
    are synchronous (for an asynchronous playback engine, see soul::Venue).
    Any code which uses a performer is responsible for making sure it calls the methods
    in a race-free way, and takes into account the fact that some of the calls may block
