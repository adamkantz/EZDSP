### SOUL Patch Loader Demo App

This folder contains a simple JUCE app which uses the patch API and helper classes to load and run patches.

To build and run it, you'll need to have an up-to-date copy of JUCE installed somewhere - it should be possible to open the `SOULPatchHostDemo.jucer` file in the Projucer, and save/run it in your favourite IDE.
